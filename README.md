# Forecasting-Principles-and-Practices-3rd-Edition--Unofficial-Solutions

[**Quick note**: Github generally struggles to display .ipynb files within online repositories and so you may have to reload the webpage a couple of times if you'd like to see the solutions online. Otherwise, you could always download these .ipynb files to view them locally (which will generally be easier).]

This repository includes my personal solutions to the excerices from Forecasting: Principles and Practices 3rd Edition, by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.

You can find their free online textbook [here](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) or purchase a physical copy [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0987507133?tag=otexts0e-21&geniuslink=true).

(Note: There may be an occasional mistake in the solutions.)
