# Forecasting-Principles-and-Practices-3rd-Edition--Unofficial-Solutions

This repository includes my personal solutions to the excerices from Forecasting: Principles and Practices 3rd Edition, by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.

You can find their free online textbook [here](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) or purchase a physical copy [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0987507133?tag=otexts0e-21&geniuslink=true).

(Note: There may be an occasional mistake in the solutions.)
